	abstract = {A reduction of nuclear waste by transmutation of trans-uranium elements ({TRUs}), such as Pu and Minor Actinides ({MAs}) contained in Spent Nuclear Fuel ({SNF}), is a goal for future reactors. In general, countries with on-going nuclear scenarios would profit from {MA} mass stabilization, while transmutation of Pu and {MAs} from {SNF} could be desired in countries in nuclear phase-out. Both missions can be accomplished by employing fast reactors loaded with fuels containing different amounts of Pu and {MAs} in a closed (or partially closed) fuel cycle. In this paper, two 1200 {MWth} sodium-cooled fast reactor cores, based on the French {ASTRID} design, are proposed for burning {TRUs} (phase-out option) or only {MAs} (on-going option). Main attention is focused on the safety and on the transmutation performance. The coolant void effect, in the region including the core and the plenum above and the Doppler constant of both systems are negative also with irradiated fuel. The conversion ratios ({CR}) of the Pu and {MA} burners are in the ranges from 0.6 to 0.7 and from 0.5 to 0.6, respectively. These results show a large safety and transmutation potential of {ASTRID} type reactors.},

	shorttitle = {Politics and Nuclear Power},
	abstract = {With the dramatic changes {OPEC} precipitated in the structure of world energy markets during the 1970s, energy became a central concern to policymakers throughout the industrialized West. This book ex-amines the responses of public officials in three leading European nations -- the Federal Republic of Germany, France, and the Netherlands -- to the energy crisis. As the study shows, the proposed energy programs in the three countries shared remarkable similarities; yet the policy outcomes were very different. To explain why, Michael T. Hatch goes beyond the specific content of government energy policy to include an analysis of the policymaking process itself.At the heart of the study is an exploration of the various dimensions of nuclear policy in West Germany. The political consensus on nuclear power that prevailed in the initial years following the energy crisis disintegrated as antinuclear "citizens' initiatives," the courts, and trade unions, as well as the traditional political parties, entered the policymaking process. Subsequent government efforts to resolve the political stalemate over nuclear power foundered in a morass of domestic electoral politics and an international debate over nuclear proliferation.Extending the analysis to comparisons with French and Dutch nuclear strategies, Hatch argues that the critical factor in determining nuclear policy was the manner in which the political system structured the nuclear debate. In contrast to West Germany, where the electoral and parliamentary systems enhanced the influence of the antinuclear "Greens," the electoral system and constellation of political parties in France served to dissipate the influence of the antinuclear forces. Thus in France the nuclear program en-countered few impediments. In the Netherlands, as in West Germany, government policy was paralyzed in the face of antinuclear sentiment across a broad spectrum of Dutch society.Hatch has provided here not only a useful examination of the development of energy policy in western Europe but also a case study of the close interplay between policy and politics.},

	abstract = {Key components of a novel methodology and implementation of an agent-based, dynamic nuclear fuel cycle simulator, Cyclus , are presented. The nuclear fuel cycle is a complex, physics-dependent supply chain. To date, existing dynamic simulators have not treated constrained fuel supply, time-dependent, isotopic-quality based demand, or fuel fungibility particularly well. Utilizing an agent-based methodology that incorporates sophisticated graph theory and operations research techniques can overcome these deficiencies. This work describes a simulation kernel and agents that interact with it, highlighting the Dynamic Resource Exchange ({DRE}), the supply-demand framework at the heart of the kernel. The key agent-{DRE} interaction mechanisms are described, which enable complex entity interaction through the use of physics and socio-economic models. The translation of an exchange instance to a variant of the Multicommodity Transportation Problem, which can be solved feasibly or optimally, follows. An extensive investigation of solution performance and fidelity is then presented. Finally, recommendations for future users of Cyclus and the {DRE} are provided.},

	abstract = {The International Atomic Energy Agency is giving continuous attention to the collection,
analysis and exchange of information on issues of back-end of the nuclear fuel cycle, an
important part of the nuclear fuel cycle. Reprocessing of spent fuel arising from nuclear
power production is one of the strategies for the back end of the fuel cycle. As a major
fraction of spent fuel is made up of uranium, chemical reprocessing of spent fuel would leave
behind large quantities of separated uranium which is designated as reprocessed uranium
({RepU}). Reprocessing of spent fuel could form a crucial part of future fuel cycle
methodologies, which currently aim to separate and recover plutonium and minor actinides.
The use of reprocessed uranium ({RepU}) and plutonium reduces the overall environmental
impact of the entire fuel cycle. Environmental considerations will be important in determining
the future growth of nuclear energy. It should be emphasized that the recycling of fissile
materials not only reduces the toxicity and volumes of waste from the back end of the fuel
cycle; it also reduces requirements for fresh milling and mill tailings. In comparison, the
method of direct disposal of spent fuel premeditates creation of larger capacity repositories for
permanent disposal. The issue of recycle and reuse of valuable material is important for the
nuclear fuel cycle in the context of sustainable growth of the nuclear energy. Recognizing the
importance of this subject, the International Atomic Energy Agency initiated the preparation
of this report to review and summarize information available on the management of
reprocessed uranium.},

member countries. As interim storage facilities in many countries reach their design capacities,
the need to optimise spent fuel storage management is becoming an increasingly important
issue to managing fuel cycle costs while reducing associated risks. In nuclear criticality safety
studies involving spent fuel, burn-up credit is being pursued and has been implemented in many
countries as a means of more accurately and realistically determining the system reactivity by
taking into account a decrease in the reactivity of spent fuel during irradiation. Implementation
of burn-up credit has gained in world-wide interest during the last 20 years and it represents one
of the most technically challenging issues in nuclear criticality safety. To address these challenges
and help co-ordinate activities in {NEA} member countries, the Working Party on Nuclear
Criticality Safety ({WPNCS}) of the {OECD}/{NEA} Nuclear Science Committee ({NSC}) has organised the

The {CYCLUS} fuel cycle simulator seeks to separate the design of the simulation from the fuel cycle or technologies of interest. In order to support this separation, a robust supply–demand communication and solution framework is required. Accordingly an agent-based supply-chain framework, the Dynamic Resource Exchange ({DRE}), has been designed implemented in {CYCLUS}. It supports the communication of complex resources, namely isotopic compositions of nuclear fuel, between fuel cycle facilities and their managers (e.g., institutions and regions). Instances of supply and demand are defined as an optimization problem and solved for each timestep. Importantly, the {DRE} allows each agent in the simulation to independently indicate preference for specific trading options in order to meet both physics requirements and satisfy constraints imposed by potential socio-political models. To display the variety of possible simulations that the {DRE} enables, example scenarios are formulated and described. Important features include key fuel-cycle facility outages, introduction of external recycled fuel sources (similar to the current mixed oxide ({MOX}) fuel fabrication facility in the United States), and nontrivial interactions between fuel cycles existing in different regions.},

	abstract = {The symbiotic equilibrium between 1.51 {GWe} breeder {SFR} (Sodium Fast Reactors) and 1.6 {GWe} {EPR}™ (European Pressurized water Reactors) is studied. {EPR}™ are only supplied with {MOX} (Mixed {OXide}) fuel to avoid the use of natural uranium. The equilibrium is studied by considering the flows of plutonium. Its isotopic composition is here described by a single real number referred to as the Pu grade. Plutonium flows through both reactor types are characterized by using linear functions of the Pu grade in new fuels. These functions have been determined by fitting data from a former scenario study carried out with the {COSI}6 simulation software.
Two different reprocessing strategies are considered. With joint reprocessing of all spent fuels, total and fissile plutonium flows balance for a unique fraction x of {EPR}™ in the fleet, equal to 0.2547. This x value is consistent with the results reported in the former scenario study mentioned above. When {EPR}™ spent fuels are used in priority to supply {SFR} (distinct reprocessing), x reaches 0.2582 at most. {COSI}6 simulations have been performed to further assess these results. The {EPR}™ fraction in the fleet at symbiotic equilibrium barely depends on the applied reprocessing strategy, so that the more flexible joint reprocessing constitutes the reference option in that case.},

	abstract = {This paper analyzes the impact of the Fukushima accident on the future of nuclear
power around the world. We begin with a discussion of the ‘but for’ baseline and the
much discussed ‘nuclear renaissance.’ Our pre-Fukushima benchmark for growth in
nuclear generation in the U.S. and other developed countries is much more modest than
many bullish forecasts of a big renaissance in new capacity may have suggested. For at
least the next decade in developed countries, it is composed primarily of life extensions
for many existing reactors, modest uprates of existing reactors as their licenses are
extended, and modest levels of new construction. The majority of forecasted new
construction is centered in China, Russia and the former states of the {FSU}, India and
South Korea. In analyzing the impact of Fukushima, we break the effect down into two
categories: the impact on existing plants, and the impact on the construction of new units.
In both cases, we argue that the accident at Fukushima will contribute to a reduction in
future trends in the expansion of nuclear energy, but at this time these effects appear to be
quite modest at the global level.},

	abstract = {La conception du coeur d’un réacteur nucléaire est fortement multidisciplinaire (neutronique, thermo-hydraulique, thermomécanique du combustible, physique du cycle, etc.). Le problème est aussi de type multi-objectif (plusieurs performances) à grand nombre de dimensions (plusieurs dizaines de paramètres de conception).Les codes de calculs déterministes utilisés traditionnellement pour la caractérisation des coeurs demandant d’importantes ressources informatiques, l’approche de conception classique rend difficile l’exploration et l’optimisation de nouveaux concepts innovants. Afin de pallier ces difficultés, une nouvelle méthodologie a été développée lors de ces travaux de thèse. Ces travaux sont basés sur la mise en oeuvre et la validation de schémas de calculs neutronique et thermo-hydraulique pour disposer d’un outil de caractérisation d’un coeur de réacteur à neutrons rapides à caloporteur sodium tant du point de vue des performances neutroniques que de son comportement en transitoires accidentels.La méthodologie mise en oeuvre s’appuie sur la construction de modèles de substitution (ou métamodèles) aptes à remplacer la chaîne de calcul neutronique et thermo-hydraulique. Des méthodes mathématiques avancées pour la planification d’expériences, la construction et la validation des métamodèles permettent de remplacer cette chaîne de calcul par des modèles de régression au pouvoir de prédiction élevé.La méthode est appliquée à un concept innovant de coeur à Faible coefficient de Vidange sur un très large domaine d’étude, et à son comportement lors de transitoires thermo-hydrauliques non protégés pouvant amener à des situations incidentelles, voire accidentelles. Des analyses globales de sensibilité permettent d’identifier les paramètres de conception influents sur la conception du coeur et son comportement en transitoire. Des optimisations multicritères conduisent à des nouvelles configurations dont les performances sont parfois significativement améliorées. La validation des résultats produits au cours de ces travaux de thèse démontre la pertinence de la méthode au stade de la préconception d’un coeur de réacteur à neutrons rapides refroidi au sodium.},

	abstract = {A novel methodology for modeling the dynamic exchange of resources among actors in the {CYCLUS} fuel cycle simulator is described. The methodology is comprised of an information gathering step, a bipartite-graph-based supply-demand matching step, and a trade execution step. Its implementation in {CYCLUS} allows the simulator to model generic fuel cycles, i.e., those in which the types of facilities and possible resource flows is not known a priori. The flow of resources at each time step is algorithmically determined based on facilities’ resource flow preferences. The dynamicsim of both the preference-based flows and quantity and quality constraints on those flows are demonstrated via two simple scenarios. The first scenario exemplifies situations in which actors’ preferences change over time and the second typifies situations in which quality-based constraints limit resource flow. This generic capability provides a sufficient framework and basis for the {CYCLUS} simulation engine to model complex, advanced fuel cycles. (author)},

	abstract = {In the framework of the {ASTRID} project at {CEA}, core design studies are performed at {CEA} with the {AREVA} and {EDF} support. At the stage of the project, pre-conceptual design studies are conducted in accordance with {GEN} {IV} reactors criteria, in particularly for safety improvements. An improved safety for a sodium cooled reactor requires revisiting many aspects of the design and is a rather lengthy process in current design approach. Two types of cores are under evaluation, one classical derivated from the {SFR} V2B and one more challenging called {CFV} (low void effect core) with a large gain on the sodium void effect. The {SFR} V2b core have the following specifications : a very low burn-up reactivity swing (due to a small cycle reactivity loss) and a reduced sodium void effect with regard to past designs such as the {EFR} (around 2\$ minus). Its performances are an average burn-up of 100 {GWd}/t, and an internal conversion ratio equal to one given a very good behavior of this core during a control rod withdrawal transient). The {CFV} with its specific design offers a negative sodium void worth while maintaining core performances. In accordance of {ASTRID} needs for demonstration those cores are 1500 {MWth} power (600 {MWe}). This paper will focus on the {CFV} pre-conceptual design of the core and S/A, and the performances in terms of safety will be evaluated on different transient scenario like {ULOF}, in order to assess its intrinsic behavior compared to a more classical design like V2B core. The gap in term of margin to a severe accident due to a loss of flow initiator underlines the potential capability of this type of core to enhance prevention of severe accident in accordance to safety demonstration.

This paper identifies the features needed to cover the range of promising fuel cycle options identified in the {DOE}-{NE} Fuel Cycle Evaluation and Screening and categorizes these features to facilitate prioritization. Features are categorized as essential functions, integrating features, and exemplary capabilities. A library of unit tests applicable to each of the essential functions should be developed as future work.

Advances in R\&D for advanced {SFR} fuel and structural materials provide key long-term opportunities to improve {SFR} economics. In addition, other new opportunities are emerging to further improve {SFR} economics. This paper provides an overview on potential ideas from the perspective of thermal hydraulics to improve {SFR} economics. These include: (1) a new hybrid loop-pool reactor design to further optimize economics, safety, and reliability of {SFRs} with more flexibility, (2) a multiple-reheat and intercooling helium Brayton cycle to improve plant thermal efficiency and to reduce safety related overnight and operation costs, and (3) modern multi-physics thermal analysis methods to reduce analysis uncertainties and associated requirements for over-conservatism in reactor design. This paper reviews advances in all three areas and their potential beneficial impacts on {SFR} economics.},

	abstract = {We assess the economics of reprocessing versus direct disposal of spent fuel. The uranium price at which reprocessing spent fuel from light water reactors ({LWRs}) and recycling the resulting plutonium and uranium in {LWRs} would become economic is estimated for a range of reprocessing prices and other fuel cycle costs. The contribution of both fuel cycle options to the cost of electricity is also estimated. A similar analysis is performed to compare fast neutron reactors ({FRs}) with {LWRs}. We review available information about various fuel cycle costs, as well as the quantities of uranium likely to be recoverable at a range of future prices. We conclude that the once-through {LWR} fuel cycle is likely to remain significantly cheaper than recycling in either {LWRs} or {FRs} for at least the next 50 yr, even with substantial growth in nuclear power.},

Special attention is given to innovations that enhance {AMETROP}’s performance both through artificial intelligence features, in which the routine uses the accumulation of data (experience) to influence its future actions, and through a family of simple performance aids, which allow the designer to use his heuristic knowledge (experience) to guide the routine’s essentially random search. Using examples from a typical fuel cycle optimization problem, the performance of the stochastic Metropolis algorithm is compared to that of the only suitable deterministic routine in a standard software library, showing {AMETROP} to have many advantages.},

If the head-end of the nuclear fuel cycle, regarding all operations before leaving the reactor, has now reached maturity, many pathways are still possible in the back-end of the cycle, dealing with the spent fuel. The long-term consequences of any decision regarding subjects such as fuel reprocessing, waste disposal, etc., require the use of strategic planning methods, in which provision is made for multiple objectives and for uncertainties. An interactive multicriteria approach using stochastic linear programming is provided by the code Strange, which has already been applied to different energy strategy problems, also outside the nuclear field. The application presented in the paper illustrates the search for a best fuel cycle policy including four criteria: production costs, the supply of raw material, the commercial balance and employment. The concept of scenarios is used to describe future uncertainties.},

In this review, we present the normalized land requirements during the life cycles of conventional- and renewable-energy options, covering coal, natural gas, nuclear, hydroelectric, photovoltaics, wind, and biomass. We compared the land transformation and occupation matrices within a life-cycle framework across those fuel cycles. Although the estimates vary with regional and technological conditions, the photovoltaic ({PV}) cycle requires the least amount of land among renewable-energy options, while the biomass cycle requires the largest amount. Moreover, we determined that, in most cases, ground-mount {PV} systems in areas of high insolation transform less land than the coal-fuel cycle coupled with surface mining. In terms of land occupation, the biomass-fuel cycle requires the greatest amount, followed by the nuclear-fuel cycle. Although not detailed in this review, conventional electricity-generation technologies also pose secondary effects on land use, including contamination and disruptions of the ecosystems of adjacent lands, and land disruptions by fuel-cycle-related accidents.},

The practical implementation of Partitioning and Transmutation implies the development of sophisticated technologies and can be more realistic if seen in a regional context.

	abstract = {This paper introduces a new methodology for explicitly incorporating uncertainties in key parameters into decision making regarding the transition between various nuclear fuel cycles. These key uncertainties—in demand growth rates, technology availability, and technology costs, among others—are unlikely to be resolved for several decades and invalidate the concept of planning for a unique optimal transition strategy. Past time-dependent analyses of the nuclear fuel cycle have confronted uncertainties by using a scenario-based approach where key variables are parametrically varied, which gives rise to inflexible courses of action associated with optima for each scenario. Instead, this work selects hedging strategies through a decision making under uncertainty framework. These strategies are found by applying a choice criterion to select courses of action that mitigate regrets. These regrets are calculated by evaluating the performance of all possible transition strategies for every feasible outcome of the uncertain parameter(s). The methodology is applied to a case study involving transition from the current once-through light water reactor fuel cycle to one relying on continuous recycle in fast reactors, and the effect of choice criterion is explored. Hedging strategies are found that preserve significant flexibility to allow alteration of the fuel cycle strategy once these uncertainties are resolved. This work may provide guidance for agent-based, behavioral modeling in fuel cycle simulators as well as decision making in real-world applications.},

Here I trace the space—time relations that configure the (possible) siting of a Geological Disposal Facility ({GDF}) for higher activity nuclear waste, through a cooperative process of volunteerism, as a matter of concern for publics in West Cumbria. The history, economy, and culture of West Cumbria is intimately connected with the nuclear industry—and, at the time of writing, the region represents the only area of England and Wales for which there are recorded expressions of interest in hosting a {GDF}. The paper demonstrates that controversy centred on the spatial ordering of the siting process by government—a politics that was rooted in the area's history with nuclear waste—and the actors and events that had structured this past. In this regard, I argue for a geographical reading of siting controversy that acknowledges the agency of the absent, and the play of distant others in configuring a public politics of the present.},

	abstract = {A research and development program is under way at the Idaho National Laboratory ({INL}) to assess the technological and scale-up issues associated with the implementation of solid-oxide electrolysis cell technology for efficient high-temperature hydrogen production from steam. This work is supported by the {US} Department of Energy, Office of Nuclear Energy, under the Nuclear Hydrogen Initiative. This paper will provide an overview of large-scale system modeling results and economic analyses that have been completed to date. System analysis results have been obtained using the commercial code {UniSim}, augmented with a custom high-temperature electrolyzer module. Economic analysis results were based on the {DOE} H2A analysis methodology. The process flow diagrams for the system simulations include an advanced nuclear reactor as a source of high-temperature process heat, a power cycle and a coupled steam electrolysis loop. Several reactor types and power cycles have been considered, over a range of reactor outlet temperatures. Pure steam electrolysis for hydrogen production as well as coelectrolysis for syngas production from steam/carbon dioxide mixtures have both been considered. In addition, the feasibility of coupling the high-temperature electrolysis process to biomass and coal-based synthetic fuels production has been considered. These simulations demonstrate that the addition of supplementary nuclear hydrogen to synthetic fuels production from any carbon source minimizes emissions of carbon dioxide during the production process.},

	abstract = {A novel methodology for the economic evaluation of hydrogen production and storage for a mixed wind–nuclear power plant considering some new aspects such as residual heat and oxygen utilization is applied in this work. This analysis is completed in the context of a Hydrogen Economy and competitive electricity markets. The simulation of the operation of a combined nuclear–wind–hydrogen system is discussed first, where the selling and buying of electricity, the selling of excess hydrogen and oxygen, and the selling of heat are optimized to maximize profit to the energy producer. The simulation is performed in two phases: in a pre-dispatch phase, the system model is optimized to obtain optimal hydrogen charge levels for the given operational horizons. In the second phase, a real-time dispatch is carried out on an hourly basis to optimize the operation of the system as to maximize profits, following the hydrogen storage levels of the pre-dispatch phase. Based on the operation planning and dispatch results, an economic evaluation is performed to determine the feasibility of the proposed scheme for investment purposes; this evaluation is based on calculations of modified internal rates of return and net present values for a realistic scenario. The results of the present studies demonstrate the feasibility of a hydrogen storage and production system with oxygen and heat utilization for existent nuclear and wind power generation facilities.},

	abstract = {The concept of sustainable development from 1980 to the present has evolved into definitions of the three pillars of sustainability (social, economic and environmental). The recent economic and financial crisis has helped to newly define economic sustainability. It has brought into focus the economic pillar and cast a question mark over the sustainability of development based on economic progress. This means fully addressing the economic issues on their own merits with no apparent connection to the environmental aspects. Environmental sustainability is correctly defined by focusing on its biogeophysical aspects. This means maintaining or improving the integrity of the Earth's life supporting systems. The concept of sustainable development and its three pillars has evolved from a rather vague and mostly qualitative notion to more precise specifications defined many times over in quantitative terms. Hence the need for a wide array of indicators is very clear. The paper analyses the different approaches and types of indicators developed which are used for the assessment of environmental sustainability. One important aspect here is setting targets and then “measuring” the distance to a target to get the appropriate information on the current state or trend.},

	abstract = {The National Ignition Facility ({NIF}), a laser-based Inertial Confinement Fusion ({ICF}) experiment designed to achieve thermonuclear fusion ignition and burn in the laboratory, will soon be completed at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Experiments designed to accomplish the {NIF}’s goal will commence in 2010, using laser energies of 1 to 1.3 {MJ}. Fusion yields of the order of 10 to 35 {MJ} are expected soon thereafter. We propose that a laser system capable of generating fusion yields of 35 to 75 {MJ} at 10 to 15 Hz (i.e., ≈ 350- to 1000-{MW} fusion and ≈ 1.3 to 3.6 x 1020 n/s), coupled to a compact subcritical fission blanket, could be used to generate several {GW} of thermal power ({GWth}) while avoiding carbon dioxide emissions, mitigating nuclear proliferation concerns and minimizing the concerns associated with nuclear safety and long-term nuclear waste disposition. This Laser Inertial Fusion Energy ({LIFE}) based system is a logical extension of the {NIF} laser and the yields expected from the early ignition experiments on {NIF}. The {LIFE} concept is a once-through, self-contained closed fuel cycle and would have the following characteristics: (1) eliminate the need for uranium enrichment; (2) utilize over 90\% of the energy content of the nuclear fuel; (3) eliminate the need for spent fuel chemical separation facilities; (4) maintain the fission blanket subcritical at all times (keff {\textless}0.90); and (5) minimize future requirements for deep underground geological waste repositories and minimize actinide content in the end-of-life nuclear waste below the (the lowest). Options to burn natural or depleted U, Th, U/Th mixtures, Spent Nuclear Fuel ({SNF}) without chemical separations of weapons-attractive actinide streams, and excess weapons Pu or highly enriched U ({HEU}) are possible and under consideration. Because the fission blanket is always subcritical and decay heat removal is possible via passive mechanisms, the technology is inherently safe. Many technical challenges must be met, but a {LIFE} solution could provide a sustainable path for worldwide growth of nuclear power for electricity production and hydrogen generation.},

Strengths and limitations of these methods and metrics for assessing sustainability are also discussed. The chapter concludes that developing absolute measures of sustainability may be the most challenging area for research. Most of the metrics for assessing sustainability performance are relative metrics rather than absolute measures. In other words, one can say that less of an impact is better but it is difficult to say what is sustainable in the absolute sense. How much carbon dioxide emitted from a product system would be considered sustainable? Even if a sustainable global greenhouse gas emissions target could be established there is no clear method for allocating a global emission threshold to a specific product system.},

This paper describes the current status and future plans for expansion of nuclear power, the advances in nuclear reactor technology, and their impacts on the associated risks and performance of nuclear power. Advanced nuclear reactors have been designed to be simpler and safer, and to have lower costs than currently operating reactors. By addressing many of the public health and safety risks that plagued the industry since the accidents at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl, these reactors may help break the current deadlock over nuclear power. In that case, nuclear power could make a significant contribution towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, significant issues persist, fueling reservations among the public and many decision makers. Nuclear safety, disposal of radioactive wastes, and proliferation of nuclear explosives need to be addressed in an effective and credible way if the necessary public support is to be obtained.},

	abstract = {A methodology, based on the multiattribute utility analysis, for the assessment of diverse fuel cycles for proliferation resistance was developed. This methodology is intended to allow for the assessment of the effectiveness of safeguards implementation at facilities within a large-scale fuel cycle and allow for the ability to choose technologies based in part on their effectiveness to deter the proliferation of nuclear materials. Fuel cycle facilities under consideration include nuclear reactors, reprocessing facilities, fuel storage facilities, enrichment plants, fuel fabrication plants, uranium conversion plants, and uranium mining and milling operations. The method uses a series of attributes (for example, Department of Energy attractiveness level, weight fraction of even Pu isotopes, measurement uncertainty, etc.) to determine a proliferation resistance measure for each step in a process flow sheet. Each of the attributes has a weighting that determines its importance in the overall assessment. Each attribute also has an associated utility function derived from both expert knowledge and physical characteristics that relates changes in the value of the attribute to its overall effect on the proliferation resistance measure. A method for aggregating proliferation resistance values for each process in a flow sheet into an overall nuclear security measure for the complete cycle was also developed. This method is focused on preventing host nation diversion; however, a similar technique could be used to analyze the risk due to theft by an insider or outsider. This methodology has been applied successfully for example fuel cycles to demonstrate its viability as an assessment methodology and its capability in discriminating diverse fuel cycle options.},
